# nunit-selenium-google-maps
Dear visitor,
thanks for checking out my code!
This demo implements an automation strategy for Google maps.com, using .Net6.0 Selenium C# with NUnit.
The code runs Chrome and Firefox in --headless mode.

Additional NuGet Packages:
- ExtentReports.Core
- SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers
- Selenium.WebDriver
- coverlet.collector

Number of test cases to execute: 54

Since the code was developed under Windows, you will have to change the path for the Firefox executable.
## CI
The project uses GitHub action which executes the end-to-end tests and generates reports when creating push and pull requests on the main branch.

## Local Test Execution
Each local test execution generates a report file. You can open each report by opening the index.html file.
Failed test cases have a screenshot attached:
```bash
{projectPath}/Report/
```
In addition, other exceptions are stored in a log file:
```bash
{projectPath}/Report/ExceptionLog
```
## Documentation
Code documentation and coverage can be found here (open the respective index.html file):
```bash
{projectPath}/Documentation/
```

## ðŸ¦¾ CMD
```bash
nunit3-console.exe ./bin/Release/GoogleMapsSeleniumCSharp.dll 
```
The tests are executed in headless mode by default (can be changed in TestBase:SetUp())
